        <p>The Negroni cocktail was born in Florence in 1919 and owes its name to Earl Camillo Luigi Manfredo Maria Negroni, 
        a man of the world who frequented the salons of the upper classes, 
        a traveller who visited England and the United States, and a passionate drinker.
        On his way to the Grand Hotel in Florence, the Earl often stopped at Casoni, 
        a grocery shop where a young man named Fosco Scarselli worked. 
        It was Fosco, who had become a friend of the Earl, who acceded to the Earl's request to 
        fortify the Americano with gin, served with a slice of orange and plenty of ice: 
        thus was born the cocktail that would later become famous as the Negroni. 
        The cocktail, which was "the usual" for the Earl, soon spread first in Florence and then in Italy and all over the world. 
        The original cocktail has undergone numerous variations that have led to a number of variations, 
        some of the most famous of which are the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>classic Negroni</li>
            <li>Negroni Sbagliato</li>
            <li>Boulevardier</li>
        </ul>
